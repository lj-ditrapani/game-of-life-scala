Usage:
java -jar game-of-life-assembly-1.1.0.jar --b=<n>    |
                                          --f=<file> |
                                          --help
                                          [--t=<n>]
                                          [--m=<n>]
                                          [--w=<n>]

--b=<n>    Run a built-in board where n is a number that maps to the
           corresponding game board as defined in the table below.

--f=<file> Run a board defined in a file on disk.  The board must be
           at least 3X3.  It can contain only +, - and newlines.  Each
           line represents a row. + means alive and - means dead.  All
           lines must be equal length.

--help     Print this help text and exit

--t=<n>    Optional argument.  The time delta between simulation steps
           in milliseconds.  Smaller n means faster simulation.
           Defaults to 500 ms.

--m=<n>    Define the width of the margins between cells in pixels.
           Defaults to 4 pixels.

--w=<n>    Defines the widths of the cells in pixels.
           Defaults to 16 pixels.
